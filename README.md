# Problem Statement
Farmers often face the challenge of determining the optimal crop to grow, which could maximize yield and profit. Precision agriculture provides a solution by using data-driven decision-making based on soil characteristics, and climate conditions.
 The goal is to reduce crop failure and help farmers make informed decisions on crop selection.
The challenge is to build a recommendation system that leverages available data on soil nutrients, weather conditions, and rainfall to suggest the best crops for a particular farm, mitigating the risk of crop failure.
