# Crop Suggestion System

An advanced data science project aimed at recommending the *most suitable crops* for a given agricultural field based on soil characteristics, weather conditions, and environmental parameters. This system leverages machine learning models and interactive data visualizations to empower farmers and agribusinesses with *data-driven insights* for optimized farming.

## Brief

This project focuses on analyzing agricultural data and applying machine learning techniques to provide actionable insights for farmers and agribusinesses. By recommending suitable crops based on key parameters like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, and weather data, this system supports *precision agriculture* and promotes sustainable farming practices.

## Project Goals

- Analyze key agricultural parameters like soil nutrients, pH, rainfall, and temperature.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for accurate crop recommendations.
- Develop an interactive dashboard for intuitive data visualization.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset) containing detailed agricultural and environmental data.

---

## How It Works

1. *Data Loading and Preparation*:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset (Crop_recommendation.csv) using Pandas.
   - Clean and organize the data for machine learning model training and analysis.

2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*:
   - Conduct detailed analysis of soil nutrients, weather, and crop characteristics.
   - Visualize relationships between features using correlation heatmaps and bar plots.

3. *Machine Learning Models*:
   - Train and evaluate models like Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
   - Identify the most accurate model using metrics like accuracy and cross-validation scores.

4. *Visualization*:
   - Generate interactive bar charts comparing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels for different crops.
   - Visualize rainfall, temperature, and humidity trends for better decision-making.

5. *Output*:
   - Provide farmers with crop recommendations tailored to their field's specific conditions.
